# killercoda Upskill Linux

A collection of task to get a better understanding of linux and it workings.
Without tha hassle of creating an own linux box in the wild and securing it.

The Tasks are loosely based on the awesome [Linux Upskill Challenge](https://linuxupskillchallenge.org/). Go there for a more indepth explanation and some greate video tutorials.

## Requirements

- Basic computer literacy
- 1-2 hours each task session

## What is not happening in this course

To keep the entry level low, we will not create our own server.
The management of a server open in the internet is complex and misconfiguration can can easily happen.
We will talk a little bit about the things you may need to secure a server, but that is not our focus here
